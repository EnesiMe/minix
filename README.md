I prolly do not know what I am getting myself into but I'd rather die trying. I came fresh from Mr. Tanenbaum's Modern Operating Systems Cha.1
I am the kind of lazy programmer that pulls up a markdown cheatsheet to write this file. Hence, it suffices to say, heck, I do not know what I am doing 
I took my University's Operating Systems course nearly 3 years ago. I've worked with RTOS somewhat.
